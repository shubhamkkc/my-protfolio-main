    <h2>Data Structures</h2>
    <p>A data structure is a particular way of organizing data in a computer so that it can be used effectively.
    <br>For example, we can store a list of items having the same data-type using the array data structure.
    Data structure is the arrangement of data in memory. They are essential for organizing, processing, retrieving, accessing, and storing data.
    Data structures usually work together with algorithms. They hold the data while algorithms solve problems using the data.
    Data structures are one of the foundational disciplines in computer science. They are pivotal to programming and a must-know for every programmer. If you've had to apply for a programming job, you will notice data structures take a huge chunk of the interviews.
    Software development is about solving problems, getting the best results in the shortest time possible, and with fewer resources. Just like a carpenter needs a hammer and nails to work so does a programmer need data structures for his job. Coding is just one aspect of a programmer's job. Tech companies spend more time designing the best algorithms to save computation power, server time, loading time, etc. It saves them time and money.</p>
